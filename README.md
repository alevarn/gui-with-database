# A gui application written in Java Swing that fetches and manipulates a MySQL database

*Comments and parts of the code are written in swedish. The sql dump file is also in swedish.*

This was a project I did in the course IV1351 Data Storage Paradigms at KTH. It's a Java GUI application that connects to MySQL. The Java GUI 
application is made up of tables, text fields and buttons, so you can display rows and add new rows and much more.
